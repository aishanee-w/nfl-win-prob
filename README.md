# nfl-win-prob
The goal of this assignment was to create a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of play calling in the NFL. To accomplish this goal, I have created a model that calculates play-by-play win probability estimates based on a variety of play-specific factors. For the purpose of this assignment, I chose to use a linear regression model that I developed in Python. I trained the model on 13 years of NFL play-by-play data from the 2010-2023 seasons, which I pulled using the nfl-data-py library (a Python library sourced from the nflfastR dataset). The model had an average precision score of 74.6% and an average recall score of 74.5%, with very similar numbers for winning and losing predictions. Analysis of the modelâ€™s interpretation of various games from the 2023 season show that it is able to accurately capture key plays and adjust win probability accordingly.
